With a small team of WordPress professionals on hand, we can provide a range of services for your website to improve your business.

## Small Projects

Your website is working pretty well, but there's that one thing that just annoys you. Maybe it's an issue with how the site looks on a particular screen size, or a bit of functionality that isn't quite working as intended.

Whether it's a bug fix or a small new feature for an existing site, we can get that resolved quickly, so you can get on with making the most of your site for your business.

Since the code is new to us (and we don't know how well maintained it is), small tasks are often charged at an hourly rate, starting at GBP Â£80 / USD $140 per hour.

## Medium Projects

Have you got the need for a new brochure site? You've already worked through the business case, what the goals are, maybe even drawn up some designs and collated your content? If so, then we can handle building out that theme and required functionality.

If everything is sufficiently defined (we'll ask you questions if it's not), we can provide a fixed-cost quote, so you'll know exactly what you're investing before the work starts.

## Large Projects

Have you just got that great idea and funding, but need help in making it all come together? We can help with that too - we'll work with you to discover why you want a website, what the real goals of the site are, who the target audience is, and define the necessary steps to get the best end result for you.

Discovery and definition is a paid service of itself, but it will provide you with the base documentation you need to move forwards with your idea.
