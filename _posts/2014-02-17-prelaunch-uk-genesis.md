These people come from over 40 countries, and the UK, of course, is one of those countries. I'm a developer who works a lot with, and on, the Genesis Framework. I'd say I'm known within the Genesis developer community, more-so after I released my first [Genesis guide][2]. Many of the leads I get have come from searches that include a reference to "UK". Yet other than a small handful of people, I donâ€™t know that many UK-based web professionals who only work with Genesis. I'm sure they exist, but I haven't seen them in the Genesis communities on [Twitter][3], [Facebook][4], [Google+][5] or [LinkedIn][6]. There isn't an existing UK Genesis community. 
## UK Genesis {#ukgenesis}

<img src="https://gamajo.dev/wp-content/uploads/ukgenesis.png" alt="UK Genesis logo" width="200" height="200" class="alignright img-border" />One of those handful who I do know about is [Jo][7], and we've started off [*UK Genesis*][8]. At the moment, it is a resource for designers and developers who want to be found *because* they use Genesis. Once launched, the site will be for clients who want to find a developer or designer *because* they use Genesis. It may also support the community side, with optional meet ups, and a handy list of people to refer to if a lead warrants it. A few of us are getting together for a meeting at the end of February 2014, which will help shape how this project will go ahead. Some initial suggestions said it could be a directory of profiles. These would show where the professional is, the type of clients they work with and the price-range they work within. This could be a paid listing, so that those who contribute to maintaining the site can justify their voluntary time. There is a separate project to do something similar for the wider UK-based WordPress developers. I'm hoping we can collaborate with them so that we end up with the best of both camps. I'm not aware of any other country-specific communities for Genesis, but if there are, please let me know. If you'd like to find out more or become involved in UK Genesis, then sign-up at [ukgenesis.co.uk][8].
