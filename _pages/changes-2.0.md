Good News! Genesis 2.0 is now available and its arrival has been greeted with lots of excitement.

After all, we’re not just talking about a simple upgrade here. Genesis 2.0 contains state of the art code and some big changes to functionality including:

<ul class="ticks">
<li><strong>HTML5</strong> supports new elements and attributes</li>
<li><strong>Schema.org microdata</strong> will enhance Genesis’s inbuilt SEO functionality</li>
<li><strong>CSS3</strong> enhances design functionality</li>
<li><strong>Custom Post Type Archives</strong> for extra SEO opportunities.</li>
</ul>

In total, Genesis 2.0 incorporates <strong>131</strong> fixes, improvements, additions and removals. It means there’s a lot to get your head around if you want to really understand the implications of its release. 

<em><strong>Updated</strong>: The guide also contains new chapters covering the additional nine changes made between Genesis 2.0.0 and Genesis 2.0.1, and 11 changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2.</em>

So as a <strong>talented web developer</strong> who creates plugins and child themes to run on the Genesis Framework, how will you ensure you make the most of the new functionality? 

Will you:
<ul class="crosses">
<li>Sift through the mass of web articles</li>
<li>Tinker and play to figure it out</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the discussion forums</li>
</ul>

<strong>All of that is going to take up your valuable time.</strong></section>

For some time now I’ve been keeping a track of every single change to the Genesis Framework and I’ve listed them on a dedicated site - http://GenesisChangelog.com. It’s the only site where you can discover this information.

But with the Ultimate Guide, I’ve gone one step further and explained all those changes.

You’ll find it’s the quickest and easiest way to get up to speed with what you can achieve with Genesis 2.0.  

<blockquote><p>Gary pulls the curtain back and gives an insider's perspective on the new changes in Genesis 2.0. If you're a technical user, you will definitely love reading this.

<blockquote><p>Gary has been an incredible asset to the Genesis community. <small>Brian Gardner, Chief Product Officer, Copyblogger Media</small></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I asked Gary if he could answer some questions and teach me how to code more effectively. It didn’t take me long to find out why so many people consider him THE authority on the Genesis Framework. <small>Robert Neu, CEO, Fat Media</small></p></blockquote>

The Ultimate Guide to Every Change in Genesis 2.0 is ready for you to <strong>download now</strong>. What’s more, it costs just £14.99. That's less than the price of a Genesis child theme, and an investment that's almost certainly less than an hour of your time at your hourly rate. And you wouldn't be able to find out such extensive details about the changes within an hour of looking at the code. If you spent the number of hours that I've done tracking these changes, you'll find that the cost of having it already done for you and written up in a handy guide is exceptionally cheap.

Each purchase comes with:

<ul class="ticks">
<li>a 30-day 100% money back guarantee</li>
<li>all updates for this Genesis 2.0 book, for free</li>
<li>PDF, EPUB (for iPad) and MOBI (for Kindle) formats</li>
</ul>

Grab your copy NOW and use it to quickly familiarise yourself with Genesis 2.0. It’s your short cut to the inside knowledge needed to create robust child themes and plugins for you or your clients.

<blockquote><p>Gary has succinctly explained each of the changes in the new version of the Genesis framework, based on his extensive contributions to the code and thorough knowledge of the discussions that went into each change. If you’re an experienced Genesis developer building themes or plugins, getting this book is an absolute no-brainer. <small>Dorian Speed, Web Designer, Up To Speed</small></p></blockquote>
