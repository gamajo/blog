As I'm in a privileged position to see a list of all the changes in Genesis 2.1, I've written them up in a new guide called <a href="http://gamajo.com/changes">Changes in Genesis 2.1</a>.

Changes in 2.1 give detailed explanations, screenshots and code snippets for 84 changes in 2.1.0 and a further four critical fixes in 2.1.1. This is the only resource where these changes are detailed.

This is the second in the series, after my previous guide, <a href="http://gamajo.com/changes-2.0">Changes in Genesis 2.0</a>. This listed a total of 151 changes covering 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.2.

The key difference this time is that I'm now selling the guides from my own <a href="http://gamajo.com/store">Gamajo Store</a>. Free sample books are also available from the store.

With the workflow nailed down to produce the PDF, EPUB and MOBI files, and a store to sell from, you can expect more Genesis and WordPress related guides to be written and available over time.
