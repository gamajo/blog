We craft quality code, make your ideas a reality, and let you focus on what you do best.

Gamajo is the technical partner for your business, with the skillset and service offering to match. Here’s how we add strategic value through code.<section> 

## Project discovery

Discovery is where we uncover all of the requirements of your project, and it’s a first opportunity to see how we can apply creative solutions to add strategic value to your project and business.

We’ll build out detailed specifics for the technical requirements, deadlines, and budget, and equip you with everything you need to confidently move forward on your project.

## Custom WordPress Development

We’re code experts and specialise in high-quality WordPress development.

We specialise in WordPress-based technical solutions which integrate with business-critical systems.

We carefully craft quality code which “just works” – and take the effort now to ensure easy adaptability and avoid the need for extensive maintenance later.

From custom WordPress plugins to improving accessibility, we have a wide variety of WordPress expertise:

*   **Custom plugins and integrations**: custom integrations with your business-critical systems. We integrate cutting-edge marketing tools with your existing systems, letting your team work more efficiently.
*   **Performance optimisation**: maximise the efficiency of your systems. We eliminate bloated code, decrease page sizes and decrease response time – all while improving user experience.
*   **Accessibility**: remove barriers to entry and comply with legal regulations with a website accessible to all users. Our team adhere to the latest, best-practice accessibility guidelines and can ensure your project does too.
*   **Custom themes**: get a website that does exactly what you need it to. Our custom themes are built around your business goals, using accurate, well-documented code for longevity.
*   **WooCommerce**: selling online? We build custom, scalable eCommerce stores and integrations using the globally trusted platform, WooCommerce.</section> <section>
